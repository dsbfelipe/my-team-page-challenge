## Overview

![screenshot](/screenshots/desktop.png)

This project was a little bit challenging in the beggining while thinking how i would make the mobile grid layout turn to the desktop version later, but in the end everything went good, i learned some new resources to use like the ":nth-child(even)" and it was a really fun challenge.
